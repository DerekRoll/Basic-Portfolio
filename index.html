            <!-- This is my bio paragraph -->
            <p>Hello, my name is Derek Roll. I have a professional background in Sales and Marketing, specifically zoned digital marketing. I have successfully developed sales teams and enjoy working in a team atmosphere. I have always had a keen interest in computers, and especially Web Development. Therefore, I have decided to redirect my talents, and change careers by devoting myself to excelling in this preparation for a new career. </p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and have had a residence in SWFL for over 20 years. I have also had the experiences of living in Washington DC, and Nashville Tn. 
                I am the proud father of Jacob age 8, and Tyler age 6. My life is very full and busy with 2 boys in elementary school, and sports.</p>
                <p>I am an avid sports fan, and enjoy spending time outside on the water boating, and fishing. I love to travel outside of the country learning new cultures, and ways of life. I recently spent a few weeks in Costa Rica. It was amazing!! I am excited to embark on this journey of learning how to write code. I look forward to conquering many challenging assignments and working as a team with many of you to achieve our goals of completing this bootcamp!!</p>
