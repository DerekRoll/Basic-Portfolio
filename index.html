            <p>Hello, My name is Derek Roll. I have a professional background in Sales and Marketing. I have decided to
                change carrers, and learn Web Development. I am a proud father of 2 boys, Jacob and Tyler. I am
                originally from Pittsburgh, Pa,
                and
                have lived in Florida off and on for over 20 years. I've resided in Washington DC, Nashville,
                and Tampa
                over the years! I am an avid sports fan, and enjoy spending time outside on the water boating,
                and fishing. I love to travel outside of the country learning new cultures, and ways of life. I
                recently
                spent a few weeks in Costa Rica. It was amazing!! I am excited to embark on this journey of
                learning how
                to write code. I look forward to conquering many challenging assignments, and working as a team
                with
                many of you to achieve our goals of completing this bootcamp too!!</p>
