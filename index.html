            <p>Hello, My name is Derek Roll. I am a proud father of 2 boys. I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pa, and have lived in Florida off and on for over 20 years. I've resided in Washington DC, Nashville, and Tampa over the years! I am an avid sports fan, and enjoy spending time outside on the water boating, and fishing. I love to travel outside of the country learning new cultures, and ways of life. I recently spent a few weeks in Costa Rica. It was amazing!!  I am excited to embark on this journey of learning how to write code. I look forward to conquering many challenging assignments, and working as a team with many of you to achieve our goals of completing this bootcamp!!</p>
